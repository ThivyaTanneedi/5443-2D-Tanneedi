## Description:

The Pygame module is being used in this code to create a game of 2048. The code loads an image of a smiley face, configures a timer and typeface, and sets up the 
display with a defined width and height. A few variables for the game state, including the values on the board, the score, and the high score, are also initialized by
the code.The code contains numerous functions, such as draw over, which displays a "Game Over" message after the game is over, and take turn, which modifies the game's
state based on a player-specified direction (up, down, left, or right).
